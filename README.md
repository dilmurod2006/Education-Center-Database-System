# Education Center Database System

**BTEC Unit 10: Database Design & Development**

## 📋 Project Overview

This project involves the design, development, and testing of a comprehensive relational database system for a private education center. The center offers various courses, including programming, foreign languages, and professional certification programs.

## 🎯 Project Goals

### Primary Objectives

- Design a normalized relational database structure for an education center
- Implement proper entity relationships and constraints
- Create a scalable and maintainable database architecture
- Ensure data integrity and security
- Provide comprehensive documentation for future maintenance

### Learning Outcomes (BTEC Unit 10)

- **P1/M1/D1**: Design a relational database system using normalization techniques
- **P2/M2/D2**: Develop database with SQL including tables, relationships, and constraints
- **P3/M3/D3**: Test database against user and system requirements
- **P4/M4/D4**: Produce technical documentation and user manual

## 🔧 Technical Requirements

### Database Management System

- **Platform**: MySQL / PostgreSQL / SQL Server (to be determined)
- **Version**: Latest stable release
- **Minimum Requirements**:
  - Support for ACID transactions
  - Foreign key constraints
  - Triggers and stored procedures
  - Views and indexes

### Design Requirements

- **Normalization**: Minimum 3NF (Third Normal Form)
